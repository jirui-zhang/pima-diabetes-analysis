1. Bar Chart: "Comparison of Average Glucose Levels by Diabetes Outcome"
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bae5693-d169-4b86-a272-8af911431ec0)

Bars:  
•	The average glucose level data is presented through vertical bars which differentiate diabetic and non-diabetic patient measurements.
•	The data shows diabetic patients in the red bars and non-diabetic patients in green bars to distinguish their results.
X-Axis:
•	Displays the diabetes outcome (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic).
Y-Axis:
•	Indicates the average glucose level.

2. Pie Chart: "Proportion of Diabetic and Non-Diabetic Cases"

Colored Slices (Segments):  
•	Each segment demonstrate the percentages between diabetic and non-diabetic cases.
Size of Segments:  
•	Shows the proportional to the total number of cases in each category.
Labels:  
•	Display the outcome (Non-Diabetic or Diabetic) while indicating the percentage distribution of cases.

3. Correlation Heatmap: "Relationship Between Features"
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25ae8e84-13c5-488d-83bc-ee183ae31abe)

Heatmap:  
•	Shows correlations between variables in the dataset.
•	Strong positive correlations exist between Glucose levels and the measured Outcome values.
Color Intensity:  
•	Intensities of color shades show correlation strength levels with light tones representing weak connections or no correlations between variables.
•	The intensity of color in the visualization serves as an indicator of correlation magnitude.

4. Histogram: "Glucose Level Distribution by Diabetes Outcome"
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c33093f3-2c85-478d-ac46-a93dcb20dea5)

Bars:
•	Each bar represents the count of individuals within a specific glucose range.
•	Separate colors represent diabetic and non-diabetic groups.
X-Axis:
•	Indicates glucose levels.
Y-Axis:
•	Indicates count of individuals.
5. Box Plot: "BMI Distribution by Diabetes Outcome"
 ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06f1dd8b-881f-4cd0-9171-9373148bd25d)

Boxes:
•	Display BMI values including ranges, quartiles and median points separately for diabetic and non-diabetic subject groups.
Outliers:
•	Points outside the whiskers represent data that significantly differ from the main distribution.
6. Scatter Plot: "Age vs. Glucose by Diabetes Outcome"
 
Points:
•	The scatterplot indicates individual cases with age on the x-axis and glucose level on the y-axis.
•	Color indicates diabetes outcome (diabetic or non-diabetic).
•	Green color shows non-diabetic and red color indicates diabetic.

Findings Highlights  
Summary from histogram, heatmap, and scatterplot Charts:  
•	Individuals with diabetes usually exhibit elevated glucose measurements and body mass index metrics.
•	A distinct shift toward elevated glucose levels appears as the main feature within the histogram among diabetic patients.
•	The correlation heatmap reveals that diabetes outcome shows a strong and positive relationship with glucose levels.
•	The scatter plot indicates older patients with elevated glucose levels demonstrate higher susceptibility to developing diabetes.
Bar chart and pie chart summary:  
•	The blood sugar measurement of diabetic individuals proves consistently higher than the blood sugar levels of non-diabetic individuals.
•	Among all detected cases approximately 34.9% prove to have diabetes.
•	People with diabetes generally show elevated BMI readings which suggests that body mass index influences the chance of developing diabetes.
