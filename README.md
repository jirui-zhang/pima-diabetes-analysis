**Figure 1:** World Map: Global Situation of Malaria  
**Introduction**  
The project showcases essential findings about global malaria burden through both interactive data visualization technology and predictive analysis techniques. Extensive malaria case records from 2000 to 2018 have enabled the report to disclose pivotal insights regarding the disease's geographical and time-based development. The research focuses on detecting worldwide patterns and seasonal variations and long-term prevalence trends of malaria together with future forecasting to support health policymaking and intervention design.

**Figure 2:** Choropleth map of global distribution of Malaria Cases (2000 - 2018)  
The choropleth map displays the spatial pattern of malaria cases which occurred in different countries from 2000 to 2018. The map uses a dynamic color range from pale yellow through deep red which symbolizes low to high malaria incidence. The nations of Nigeria, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Uganda and Mozambique and India in South Asia have become the most afflicted areas alongside them. Malaria transmission remains minimal in the countries of North America, Europe and Australia because these regions display a pale appearance. This map highlights which parts of the world experience the most malaria and demonstrates which areas most urgently require intervention efforts.  
**Significance:** The map operates as a global health monitoring tool because it helps international organizations locate their most critical malaria control areas thus directing their resource distribution accordingly.

**Figure 3:** Line Graph showing Malaria Cases and Deaths over Time  
The annual global malaria cases and deaths between 2000 and 2018 appear in a dynamic line chart. The displayed graph shows changing infection counts along with significant decreases in death numbers which indicate current successes in medical treatment and disease prevention methods. Across the time period the many recorded cases show that ongoing health challenges remain especially in lower and middle-income nations. The chart facilitates a clear comparison between the trends in infections and fatalities over time.  
**Significance:** The timeline enables stakeholders to monitor intervention effectiveness across different time periods and notify them about policy or funding shift needs in response to changing healthcare trends.  
**Top 20 Countries with Highest Malaria Cases**

**Figure 4:** Bar Chart of Top 20 Countries with Highest Malaria Cases  
The horizontal bar graph presents rankings of the top twenty nations reporting malaria cases which dated from 2000 up to 2018. Nigeria ranks in first position whereas the Democratic Republic of Congo occupies second place followed by India in third and Uganda in fourth position and Mozambique in fifth rank. The readability of the bars improves significantly through color codes which demonstrates the unequal distribution of malaria throughout nations. Twenty countries appear in the chart whose combined cases represent vital portions of worldwide malaria cases.  
**Significance:** The visualization enables focused global financial support and attention to reach the countries most affected by malaria so that intervention planning proceeds efficiently and equitably.  
 
**Country-Wise Contribution to Global Burden**

**Figure 5:** Treemap of Malaria Cases by Country  

This visual represents how countries affect malaria globally through proportional rectangle dimensions. A divided rectangle chart displays malaria case frequency through scale while countries are distinguished by color undertones. The treemap reveals the same conclusions as bar chart results through its visual representation which shows disease concentration in select few affected areas.  
**Significance:** The treemap provides a compact visual summary of case concentration, supporting rapid comparison between countries and strengthening arguments for targeted health interventions.  
**Forecasting Malaria Trends**

**Figure 6:** Prediction Model  
The forecasting of future malaria cases adopted a simple linear regression approach using historical data. The basic model shows that malaria case levels will maintain their current state or possibly decrease when there are no major adjustments to ongoing interventions. Predictive analytics has proven useful for developing public health strategies according to this model demonstration. Future predictive models should incorporate environmental data including rainfall measurements together with temperature readings and humidity statistics to improve their accuracy.  
**Significance:** Predictive modeling enables governments and NGOs to create proactive plans because it helps them prepare for coming outbreaks while assessing future outcomes of current malaria control strategies.  
	**Data and Methodology**  
**Data**  
The project obtains its data from Kaggle through multiple organizations including World Health Organization and national health ministries which accumulated global malaria case reports. The dataset stretches across the period from 2000 to 2018 while containing information about country locations, yearly data and the reported number of cases together with casualty statistics.  
**Method**  
•	Loading of the dataset, cleaning operations and data transformation utilized Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.   
•	Visualizations were built through the use of Plotly Express.   
•	The development of treemaps and plots used both Python libraries Matplotlib and Seaborn.   
•	Predictive modeling was implemented using Scikit-learn, with a focus on linear regression.  
**Significance**  
The analysis reveals fundamental global patterns in malaria data through extensive and long-term visual representations. This analysis displays key locations and patterns of occurrence as well as cyclic patterns and present obstacles in malaria prevention efforts. The project functions as a practical research instrument for both public health agencies and researchers and policymakers because it applies visual narratives and machine learning methods. These study results provide essential data for directing intervention timing and targets as well as funding allocation and international collaboration opportunities to fight malaria. The project follows its purpose to create a malaria-free future by providing data-based strategic insights.
