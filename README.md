**Legend Explanation**  
 **World Map Color Gradient (White → Dark Blue)**  
•	White: Countries with no reported malaria cases or missing data.  
•	Light Blue: Countries with a lower number of reported malaria cases.  
•	Dark Blue: Countries with the highest reported malaria cases.  
•	The deeper the shade of blue, the higher the number of malaria cases reported over the period 2000–2018.  
**Tree Map Size of Each Box**  
•	Proportional to the total number of cases or deaths reported.  
•	Larger boxes shows greater burden.  
**Color of Boxes**  
•	Each country or region is assigned a distinct color using the Set1 qualitative palette.  
**Bar chart**  
X-axis:  
•	Represents the number of malaria cases (in millions), scaled for readability.  
•	Bars extend horizontally to indicate magnitude.  
Y-axis:  
•	Lists the top 20 countries with the highest malaria cases between 2000 and 2018.  
**Bar Length:**  
•	Proportional to the number of reported cases.  
•	Longer bars = more cases.  
**Findings Highlights**  
•	Nigeria consistently appears at the top with over 400 million reported cases.  
•	Other highly affected countries include Democratic Republic of Congo, India, Uganda, Mozambique, and Burkina Faso.  
•	Sub-Saharan Africa stands out with the highest intensity of malaria cases.  
•	South and Southeast Asia (especially India and Indonesia) also show significant case numbers.  
•	Regions like North America, Europe, and Australia appear white, indicating no significant malaria burden.  
•	Treemaps visually reinforce that a few countries account for most cases and deaths.
