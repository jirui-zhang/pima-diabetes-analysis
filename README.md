**Legend Explanation**   
Bars:    
•	The average glucose level data is presented through vertical bars which differentiate diabetic and non-diabetic patient measurements.
•	The data shows diabetic patients in the red bars and non-diabetic patients in green bars to distinguish their results.  
X-Axis:  
•	Displays the diabetes outcome (0 = Non-Diabetic, 1 = Diabetic).  
Y-Axis:  
•	Indicates the average glucose level.   
**Findings Highlights**  
•	The blood sugar measurement of diabetic individuals proves consistently higher than the blood sugar levels of non-diabetic individuals.
•	People with diabetes generally show elevated BMI readings which suggests that body mass index influences the chance of developing diabetes.
•	The data in the bar chart shows that glucose levels differ significantly between patients who have diabetes and those without.
•	The combination of static with interactive visualizations helps stakeholders develop better insight into diabetes patterns which enables them to outline efficient preventive strategies.
